# Welcome to Power Comp

_Administration and Participation made easy._

The development of this software was made possible thanks to the initiative from the [South Swedish Powerlifting Federation](https://sydsvenska.styrkelyft.se/) and their funding.

It is recommended to use the demo at **[pcms2.dahlgren.tech](http://pcms2.dahlgren.tech/)** along with the documentation to get a better understanding of how it works.
